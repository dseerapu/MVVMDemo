# MVVMDemo

Base Architecture contains BaseFragment, BaseActivity, BaseAdapter & EndlessBaseAdapter


## Programming Practices Followed
* Android Architectural Components from Google
* Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection 
* MVVM Pattern
* Retrofit2 with Okhttp
* Dynamic Data Binding
* Builder, View Holder & Repository Patterns
* SOLID Principles

Architecture I have followed:
* **[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)** :  Cut down on findViewByIds and make data observing / reactive UI elements
* **[Lifecycle ](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle)** :  Create lifecycle aware components
* **[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)** :   A observable stream of data your Activities & Fragments can react to
* **[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/)** :  Define in-app navigation stacks in a single, concise testable file
* **[Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/)** :  Paginate loading data from data sources
